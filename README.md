# maze-gen
Maze Generator and Solver in Python
Algorithm's Used:
* Prim's Randomized Algorithm
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search


## maze-gen.py
This script creates a maze using Prim's Randomized algorithm. After a maze is created, it's important to copy over the maze, maze entrance, maze exit, height, and width values into the dfs.py and bfs.py scripts

## bfs.py
This script uses breadth-first search to find the exit to the maze. Once the exit is found, a .jpg of the cells visisted and maze path is created to show results. 

## dfs.py
This script uses depth-first search to find the exit to the maze. Once the exit is found, a .jpg of the cells visisted and maze path is created.
